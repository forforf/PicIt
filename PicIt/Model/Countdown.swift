    // I'm not entirely happy with having a function to express the state of the class.
    // It's primary purpose at the moment is to determine if an countdown implementation
    // should be re-initialized (i.e. restart the timer).
    // To explain further. An alternate approach (that didn't work out) would be to use an
    // optional (i.e. `Countdown?`. And set it to nil when we want to stop the timer, and
    // to restart the timer, we check if it's nil, and recreate it if it is. For example:
    // let countdown == countdown ?? Countdown() (remember the type is Countdown?)
    // The problem with that approach is that `nil` is not a publisher, so `onReceive` blows up
    // So we get around that by having a `DisabledCounter` that is a valid publisher, it just
    // doesn't publish anything. But then we still needed a check to see if the timer needed
    // replacing on restart ... so we ended up with this function.
    // Another approach considered, but rejected was to have a single class, and have
    // isDisabled control timer actions. Rejected this because it would require conditional checks
    // throughout the class which would muddy the logic.
